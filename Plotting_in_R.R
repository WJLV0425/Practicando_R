## PLOTTING IN R.

# We can make simple plot using the "plot()" function. Now we we will simulate 50 values from a normal distribution using rnorm() and assign these to "x" and similarly generate and assign 50 normally distributed values to "y". We can plot these values i the following way:

x = rnorm(50)
y = rnorm(50)
# pch = 19 stands for filled dot
plot(x,y,pch = 19, col= 'blue')

# We can also generate a line plot type of graph by adding 'type=l' inside 'plot()'.
plot(x,y,pch = 19, col= 'blue', type = "l")

# Now we'll look at a very strong graphical library called 'ggplot2' (Wickham H.). Let's have a look at the 'all_prices' data frame, for this example:

str(all_prices)

#We've got to install and load (we always load packages at the beginning of the script) 'ggplot2'.

install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

# Naming axis. "aes()" stands for aesthetics, inside it we define both 'x' and 'y' axis with variable names.

ggplot(all_prices, aes(x = items, y = jan_price)) +
  geom_point()

# We can also compute and mark the prices in January.

ggplot(all_prices, aes(x=items, y=jan_price)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(stat = "summary", fun.y = "mean", colour = "red", size = 3)

# Plotting the price of January against the price of June and make separate plots using facet_grid(. ~ items).

ggplot(all_prices, aes(x=jan_price, y=june_price)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ items)

# We also can add a linear model fit by using a `start_smooth()` layer:

ggplot(all_prices, aes(x=jan_price, y=june_price)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ items) +
  # se = TRUE inside stat_smooth() shows confidence interval.
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, col= "red")
